.Sh NAME
.Nm esnc
.Nd Essence, the simple text editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm esnc
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Essence is a very minimal imitation of the famous
.Tn GNU Emacs
editor. Unlike most popular Emacs derivatives,
Essence strives to use as little system resources as possible and be simple
enough for the casual programmer to understand, yet still include all
the functionality required for most text editing jobs. You are encouraged
to study the software sources and add any missing
.Qq essential
features to produce your own perfect editor.
.Pp
If invoked with no file arguments, the editor creates a
.Qq main
buffer that should be renamed
.Ic ( C-x n )
and written to disk
.Ic ( C-x C-s )
if the user intends to preserve the contents.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev Em TERM
informs the editor to capabilities of the user's terminal. Also the values of
.Ev Em TERMCAP , TERMPATH ,
and
.Ev Em HOME
must be sane for
.Xr termcap 5
to function properly.
.Sh FILES
None, aside from those implied by
.Xr termcap 5 .
.Pp
Your system manager should have copied the supplied printer-ready chart of key
bindings to
.Pa /usr/local/share/esnc/Essence.keys .
Carry this with you at all times until everything is permanent etched in
wetware. One could also learn much from the tutorial in-built to
.Tn GNU Emacs ,
as Essence supports many
.Qq standard
bindings.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -ohang
.It Em Unbelievable screen size
The terminal options (see
.Xr termios 4 )
have undefined column or row size information, and is usually a sign of a
broken configuration somewhere. A temporary fix on UN*X is to type at the
shell:
.Ic stty cols 80 rows 24
.It Em Environment variable TERM not defined
As it says. The majority of users would have TERM = vt100 or
thereabouts.
.It Em Insufficient termcap (needs cl & cm abilities)
Essence requires a terminal that can clear the screen and position the cursor. A
serious system problem if not logged-in via a line-printer.
.It Em Terminal description too big
.It Em Can't read terminal capabilities
.It Em Can't set terminal mode
.It Em Can't restore terminal flags
All the above are likely to involve a serious system problem.

.Sh AUTHORS
Essence is a fork of Ersatz Emacs.
Ersatz is a derivative work of MicroEMACS 3.6, as released to mod.sources and
the Public Domain by Daniel Lawrence in 1986, and is itself based on the work
of Steve Wilhite and George Jones to MicroEMACS 2.0 (then also public domain)
by Dave Conroy.
.Pp
Chris Baird <cjb@brushtail.apana.org.au> stripped out most of the features he
personally never used from 3.6, played with it for twelve years, completed the
key-bindings chart, wrote a man-page, and produced what you see today. His
additions are in the Public Domain as well.
.Sh BUGS
None known. There are however a few discrepancies in imitating
.Tn GNU Emacs .
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
As file writes are done 
.Qq over the top of
the existing file, the file ownership and permission bits are preserved,
however if an error should occur during a save this may leave a damaged file on
the filesystem.
